# quaint

This is the future home of the R package quaint! This packages uses quartet frequencies from a set of gene trees to characterize introgression across a species tree.

Currently quaint is just a collection of functions (quaint_functions.R) and a script showing how to use those functions (run_quaint.R). If you have any questions about quaint, please email me (ethan.baldwin@uga.edu).

Stay tuned for a fully documented R package and improved functionality!
